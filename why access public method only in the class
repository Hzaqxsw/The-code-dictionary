public class MyClass {
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("Instance method called");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // To call instanceMethod, you need to create an instance of MyClass
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
        myObject.instanceMethod(); // Calling instance method
    }
}


/*
In this code, instanceMethod() is an instance method of the class MyClass. To call instanceMethod(), 
we first create an instance of MyClass using the new keyword (MyClass myObject = new MyClass();) 
and then call instanceMethod() on that instance (myObject.instanceMethod();).

If you try to call an instance method without creating an instance of the class,
you'll encounter a compilation error because the instance method is associated with instances of the class and requires an object context to execute. 
On the other hand, static methods can be called directly on the class itself, without needing an instance of the class.
