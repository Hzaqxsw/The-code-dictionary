In ArrayList, get() is used to retrieve elements by their index.
In Map, get() is used to retrieve values associated with keys.


ArrayList:

get(int index) method is used to retrieve an element at a specific index in an ArrayList.
ArrayList is an ordered collection that allows fast random access to elements by index.




Map (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap):

get(Object key) method is used to retrieve the value associated with a specific key in a map.
Maps are key-value pairs, and the get() method retrieves the value associated with the specified key.
Maps do not maintain a specific order of elements like ArrayList. Elements are accessed based on their keys, not their positions.
