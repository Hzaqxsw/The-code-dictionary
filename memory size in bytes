memory size in bytes:

Data Type Size:

char: 1 byte
short: 2 bytes
int: 4 bytes
long: 4 or 8 bytes (depends on the system)
float: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes
Custom data types or structures: Sum of the sizes of their members

Array Size:
Number of elements in the array

Memory Size Calculation:
For a single data type variable: Size of data type in bytes
For an array of data type: Size of data type in bytes * Number of elements



Questiones
the memory cost difference between storing the address of a 32-entry int array and a 300-entry int array depends on the architecture and the size of a memory address on the system. Let's break it down?

Hint: size of int array and address 

Size of an address: The size of an address depends on the system architecture.
32-bit system: 4 bytes for an address
64-bit system: 8 bytes for an address
